# DARWIN-EU: Uptake of meningococcal vaccines by the target population in Europe

Meningococcal vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule in targeted 
children and adolescent population to prevent Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD). 
Various Meningococcal vaccines have been developed to target distinct serogroups
of the bacteria Neisseria Meningitidis including groups A, B, C, W and Y
responsible for IMD. The current vaccination schedule in countries within Europe
have recommended the uptake of three doses of Meningococcal group B (MenB)
vaccines for children at age 2, 4 and 12 months, a single dose of MenC or
Haemophilus influenzae type b/Meningococcal group C (Hib/MenC) vaccines at age 12
months, and quadrivalent Meningococcal groups ACWY (MCV4) vaccines as a single
dose scheduled for adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age as the main
vaccination schedule, but given as early as age 11 in certain countries,
for the prevention of severe meningococcal infection. MCV4 is also included as
part of the immunisation schedule in children aged two years or below in multiple
countries in the EU including Austria, Belgium, Cyprus and Italy. This study aims
to generate comprehensive evidence on the coverage of these separate types of
meningococcal vaccines within the target population across six countries within Europe.
